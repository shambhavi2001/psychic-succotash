Hi people! 
This is Shambhavi Gupta, I am a 17 year old from India.
I just got in college and I am aspiring to be a software engineer.
I have always found programming interesting, with the logic and analytical skills it requires.
I love eating pizza, however I get to eat it, very less often, owing to how expensive it is!
But either ways I love it!
